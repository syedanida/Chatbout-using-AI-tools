# **Chatbot assisted Data Science: New York City Airbnb Data Analysis**

## **Project Overview**
This project involves performing an in-depth analysis on the New York City Airbnb dataset using the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology. The goal is to extract meaningful insights, preprocess data, and build predictive models to understand key factors influencing the price of Airbnb listings.

## **Assignment Requirements**
1. Use **advanced chatbot-assisted coding** and data science tools.
2. Leverage tools such as **ChatGPT Pro**, **GitHub Copilot**, **Google Colab Pro**, and **AutoGluon** to streamline the data science process.
3. Perform a complete data science workflow, including data preparation, EDA, modeling, and evaluation.
4. **Publish findings** in a well-structured Medium article and include visuals, reports, and code outputs.

## **Workflow**
1. **Business Understanding**:
   - Define the problem: Predict income based on listing features.
2. **Data Understanding**:
   - Analyze and visualize key patterns in the dataset.
3. **Data Preparation**:
   - Handle missing values and outliers, and perform feature engineering.
4. **Modeling**:
   - Use various machine learning techniques for income prediction.
5. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
6. **Reporting & Sharing**:
   - Create a **Medium article** detailing the project and share the results.

## **Key Tools & Techniques**
- **AutoGluon** for automated model building and tuning.
- **Google Colab Pro** for efficient computational resources.
- **ChatGPT Pro** for code assistance and explanations.
- **GitHub Copilot** for coding suggestions.
